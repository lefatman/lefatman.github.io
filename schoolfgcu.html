            <hr class="wil-opacity" style="width:200px">
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am first and foremost a Human, a Jamaican and a Student (in that order).I have intermediate knowledge of programming but I am honestly rusty.I have practical work experience but in the field of Biochemistry rather that Software Engineering.
                Please see this link for my linked in<br> https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-andrew-smith-726244156/
            </p>
            <h3>First Impressions</h3>
            <p>When I came to the US earlier this/ year I had no idea what to expect. I had heard so much about the general situation since the last election and honestly, I was scared. To tell the truth I have been here before but that was California (a
                whole other country really), to my pleasant surprise I have found the states very accommodating and I have kind of fallen in love with this country. I was born in a tropical paradise but I find here several times more beautiful than the
                eden I left behind.</p>
            <h3>Field Report</h3>
            <p>When many people think of the Field of computing and technology they tend to think of three main profession, those being namely; Computer Scientist , Software Engineer and ICT Manager. In fact many people see these professions as analogous
                (though nothing could be further from the truth). Computer science is the research and study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis of External (non-neural) computing. It is the Empirical study of non-neural
                calculation, logic and its applications as well as the methodical study of its feasibility, structure, mode of expression, and implementation of the systematic instructions (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation,
                processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.The basis of computational theory truly precedes the innovation of the modern Digital CPU . It was first thought that Charles Babbage (inventor of the Analytical Engine)
                was the father of Computer Science with Ada Lovelace as the first Computer Programmer.This belief held for almost centuries until the discovery of the Antikythera Mechanism which theoretically predates the previously earliest known computational
                device of this type by over a thousand years. Though Highly need Computer Science as a field is starting to show signs of saturation. Software application Engineering is the application of engineering methods to programming and the development
                of software.When the first digital computer systems appeared in the early-mid 20th century,their programs were physically integrated into their systems. Therefore the abstraction of "software" from “hardware” started with said abstraction
                being used to handle the intricacy of computing.Software Engineers are here today because of the low quality software being produced at the time. The discipline being more or less the solution to all that bogged the software industry down.
                Projects within time and projected cost; guaranteeing that software is built methodically, rigorously,on time, and on budget. Engineering as a whole is a discipline meant to mitigate these very things. Thus the same concepts used in engineering
                can be used in software development . While Software Engineers tend focus on the non-physical aspects of Computing, ICT Managers are heavily focused on the execution of efficient software systems. Information and communications technology
                (ICT) is an another way to refer to information Technology (IT) which stresses the function of the unified interactions and the melding of telecoms ( ethernet and wifi ) and computer systems with needed business applications , middleware,
                storage, and audio-visual systems, which enable users to gain access to, store, transfer, and manipulate information.Despite the power of computer systems to enhance and reform educational practices, inappropriate implementation is an
                extensive problem beyond the reach of increased funding and technological advances with little proof that teachers and tutors are effectively incorporating ICT into daily scholastic life. Underlying barriers such as a belief in more conventional
                education, archaic attitudes towards computer systems in education as well as the Educator’s own feelings towards computers combined with their ability to utilize them ;all result in diminished effectiveness in the integration of ICT in
                the classroom. Out of the three disciplines ICT Seems to be the one with the most viability as it has shown any stagnation since it’s development. This all comes down to the simple fact that each of these disciplines is unique , with little
                true overlap in functionality.</p>

            <h3>Javascript Used</h3>
            <h4>Audio.js</h4>
            <p>The Algorithm I came up with for this function was simple.Since I needed to automatically lower the background music used on three of my pages. The Algorithm is as follows:<br> "Sense page load ,alert volume control page has loaded;Auto-lower
                volume by specific increment.""</p>
            <p>The Pseudocode is as follows:<br> Function setThree{<br> Event listener for page load, on page load trigger(setThree){<br> var= detected audiofile<br> set var volume to .3}}</p>
            <h4>Get Name</h4>
            <p>Problem Statement:<br> Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.</p>
            <p>Function takes the users name as a variable "x" and outputs it as html text</p>
            <h4>ConvertTemp</h4>
            <p>Problem Statement:<br> Write a program that converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius.<br> Implement the above exercise doing the processing / calculations within a method / function.</p>
            <p>Function takes the users input from text field and uses it as a variable the function then , through the use of for loops and if statements, converts the input from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa depending on the radio button selected.</p>
            <h4>ConvertRom</h4>
            <p>Problem Statement:<br> Write a program that converts numbers 1-10 to Roman Numerals.<br> Write a program that converts numbers 1-5000 to Roman Numerals.</p>
            <p>Function takes the users input from text field and uses it as a variable the function then , through the use of for loops and if statements, converts the input from roman numerals to arabic numbers or vice versa depending on the radio button
                selected.it does this by comparing two arrays 1 with roman numeral general values and another with their general counterparts.</p>
